									<h2>News</h2>
								</header>
								<h3><em>10.5.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 2.0 released</h3>
								<p>The beta testing phase has ended. vAmiga 2.0 has been released.</p>
								<h3><em>18.4.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 2.0 Beta 4 released</h3>
								<h3><em>10.4.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 2.0 Beta 3 released</h3>
								<h3><em>16.3.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 2.0 Beta 1 released</h3>
								<p>First things first: You may wonder when vAmiga 1.1 will be released. There have been many beta versions over the last months, so the release of the final version should be imminent. In fact, there will be no 1.1 release at all. Over the last months so many features have been added to the emulator that a 1.x version number would not be appropriate anymore. Therefore, I have decided to increase the version number directly to 2.0.</p>
								<p>With today's release of version v2.0b1 an important milestone has been reached: vAmiga is now feature complete. Everyone is encouraged to test the beta version as much as possible. If you encounter any issues, please let me know by opening a bug on GitHub. Once the app proves stable, the official 2.0 version will be released to the public.</p>

								<h3><em>31.1.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 1.1 Beta 9 released</h3>
								<p>In this release, the DDF logic has been reworked from scratch based on the Agnus schematics provided by the <a href="https://github.com/nonarkitten/amiga_replacement_project">Amiga Replacement Project</a>.</p>

								<h3><em>3.9.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 1.1 Beta 1 released</h3>
								<p>During the last weeks I worked a lot on the code base of vAmiga and VirtualC64. My goal was to align the code bases of both emulators as much as possible, which I managed to do to a large extent. This effort will ease the maintenance of both emulators in future. In the process of refactoring, many internal changes have been made that are not noticeable to the user. However, due to the far-reaching changes, it is likely that one or the other bug has found its way in. For this reason, the new version is released as a beta version first.</p>
								<p>The biggest change from a user's point of view is the newly added drop layer, which automatically blends in when a media file (ADF, DMS, etc.) is dragged into the emulator. Now changing disks is even simpler than it already was in the old version.</p>
								<p>Last but not least, the speed of the emulator has been optimized. In warp mode, vAmiga 1.1 runs up to 15% faster than the previous version.</p>

								<h3><em>27.5.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 1.0.1 released</h3>
								<p>This version is a small update fixing some crashes that were reported for v1.0.</p>

								<h3><em>27.5.2021 &nbsp;</em>Two more videos uploaded</h3>
								<p>I have added two more videos to the 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk9tUTMPMSQdxhKeeJRpNAA">Youtube channel</a>.
								Both show The Black Lotus (Eon) running in vAmiga. The first one shows the original demo.
								The second one runs the demo in the DMA debugger.</p>

								<h3><em>26.5.2021 &nbsp;</em>DMA debugger in action</h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFVwy4gTaE&t=1s">In this video</a>, you can
									watch <it>Rink a Dink: REDUX (Lemon)</it> running in vAmiga with the DMA debugger 
									enabled. It reveals some of the graphics tricks of this great demo.</p>

								<h3><em>11.5.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 1.0 released</h3>
								<p>After two and a half years of development, I am proud to announce the release of V1.0. 
									I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who helped me realize the 
									emulator during this long time. Without the valuable advice from coders, testers and 
									other emulator makers, I would never have gotten this far with this project.</p>

								<h3><em>11.5.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga in action</h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H4jfGa0ImU">In this video</a>, you will watch
									the Amiga PreRelease of Athanor 2 - Legend of the Birdmen. I am excited to see this awesome 
									game running in vAmiga. The video was recorded using the emulator's screen capture function.</p>
	
								<h3><em>20.4.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 1.0 Beta 1 released</h3>
								<p>Although not perfect yet (it will never be), vAmiga has proven to be pretty stable 
									by now. Therefore I think it is time to say goodbye to the 0.9 release scheme.</p>

								<h3><em>23.1.2021 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 0.9.17 released</h3>

								<h3><em>30.12.2020 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 0.9.16.2 with ARM support released</h3>
								<p>Today, a new version of vAmiga has been released. The update has been optimized for
									macOS Big Sur and supports Mac computers with Apple silicon.</p>

								<h3><em>25.11.2020 &nbsp;</em>No ARM support</h3>
								<p>Please note that vAmiga does work on Macs with ARM CPUs, yet. It will probably take a
									while until ARM models will be supported, because I currently don't have the
									appropriate hardware at hand.</p>

								<h3><em>25.11.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.15 released</h3>
								<p>Today, a new version of vAmiga has been released. The update comes with several
									compatibilty improvements and support for 3.5" HD diskettes. Detailed release notes
									can be found on the GitHub releases page.</p>

								<h3><em>18.11.2020 &nbsp;</em> Third-party game pad support</h3>

								<p>At the moment, both VirtualC64 and vAmiga are still lacking support for some popular
									game controllers. Since I can only make the necessary code changes for devices in my
									possession, I have created an <a
										href="https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/35K6X4B0FIEOF/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_2?_encoding=UTF8&type=wishlist">Amazon
										wishlist</a> containing a number of yet incompatible devices. If you want to
									have another controller supported, please let me know the exact model name. I will
									then add it to the wishlist, and with a bit of luck, a noble donor will be found who
									will order the device.
								</p>

								<h3><em>11.10.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.13 released</h3>

								<p>This release of vAmiga adds the ability of recording videos (FFmpeg is required to be
									installed on your machine). Furthermore, it fixes two important issues that had been
									introduced recently. In v0.9.10.1, a sprite sequencer bug found its way into the
									emulator that caused graphics glitches in many demos. Furthermore, the emulator does
									no longer crash when a snapshot is loaded.
								</p>

								<h3><em>29.9.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.12 released</h3>

								<p>vAmiga continues to stabilize. The latest version which has been released today
									contains several compatibility improvements and adds the ability to encode and
									decode DOS disks.
								</p>

								<h3><em>1.7.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.8.4 released</h3>

								<p>The vAmiga project is on track and stabilizing. Compatibility has improved
									considerably since the release of v0.9. As always, bug reports on GitHub are
									very welcome.
								</p>

								<h3><em>22.4.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9 released</h3>

								<p>I am proud to announce that vAmiga has left the alpha testing phase today. Bug
									reports on GitHub are highly appreciated.</p>

								<h3><em>5.3.2020 &nbsp;</em> New web site in place</h3>

								<p>The old web page is gone for good. I replaced it by a new template scheme which
									allows me to publish in a more blog-style manner.</p>

								<h3><em>4.3.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga status update</h3>

								<p>vAmiga development is going well. Many pending compatibility issues have been
									solved and development is shifting towards refactoring and cleaning up the
									code base. Once this is done, the emulator is ready for its first v0.9 release.
