								<h2>Using Input Devices</h2>

								<h3>Keyboard</h3>

								<p>
									Although the Amiga is quite an aged computer by now, it already utilized a keyboard
									whose layout was quite similar to the ones used today. Therefore, in vAmiga you will
									be using the native Mac keyboard for typing, and for most Amiga keys you will find a
									perfect match on your native keyboard. However, there are exceptions. For example,
									the Amiga is equipped with a special help key that has no direct counterpart on the
									Mac keyboard. Also, some Mac keys are directly linked to operating system actions,
									which affects emulation. The most prominent examples are the two Command keys that
									are used to trigger operating system actions.
								</p>
								<p>
									In cases where you need to press a key that is not directly accessible from your
									native keyboard, you can use the vAmiga's virtual keyboard. It can be opened
									permanently via the corresponding option in the keyboard menu:
								</p>
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/keyboard1.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									The virtual keyboard is opened in a separate window.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/keyboard2.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To press a single key on the
									virtual keyboard, simply press the corresponding icon with the left mouse button.
									Clicking with the right mouse button holds down a keys until it is clicked again.
									This allows the user to press more complex combinations, such as Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga,
									which resets the computer.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/keyboard3.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									The layout of the virtual keyboard automatically adapts to the current Kickstart
									rom. If an Amiga 1000 Boot Rom is installed, the virtual keyboard appears in the
									form of the old Amiga 1000 keyboard:
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/keyboard4.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									A second way to open the virtual keyboard is to use the corresponding icon in the
									emulator window toolbar. In this case, the keyboard does not open permanently in a
									separate window. Instead, it opens as a sheet and closes automatically when a key is
									pressed.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/keyboard5.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									As already stated, macOS relies heavily on the usage of the command keys. Therefore,
									these keys are not mapped to their counterparts, the two Amiga keys on the Amiga
									keyboard, by default. However, if you wish to do so, you can establish this mapping
									by selecting the appropriate entry in the keyboard menu. Please note that direct
									assignment of the control keys requires additional permissions, which must be
									explicitly granted to vAmiga by the user. When the option is activated for the first
									time, macOS will guide you through the necessary steps.
								</p>
								<h3>Mouse</h3>
								<p>
									The Amiga mouse is typically connected to port 1, which is also the default setting
									in vAmiga.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/mouse1.png" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									The Amiga mouse is directly connected to the native Mac mouse when the
									permission to control the mouse has been given to the emulator. There are several
									ways to lock and unlock the mouse, which can be customized in the preferences. By
									default, the mouse is handed over to vAmiga by clicking inside the emulator window
									and returned to macOS by simply shaking it.
								</p>
								<p>
									vAmiga supports a wide range of joysticks and gamepads. I personally recommend using
									a Speedlink Competition Pro USB joystick, which in my opinion offers the best gaming
									experience. Another option is to use an original Amiga or Atari joystick from back
									in the day (e.g. an original Competition Pro). These devices can be connected via
									special USB connectors such as the RetroFun! USB adapter.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you do not own a genuine joystick or gamepad, you can use keyboard joystick
									emulation instead. Keysets can be configured in the application preferences.
