After plugging in an external USB device, vAmiga checks the device for compatibility. If a suitable gamepad is detected, vAmiga allows the user to adjust the axis assignment. vAmiga comes with a list of known devices and automatically chooses the correct axis assignment when such a device is detected. For gamepads that are not known to the emulator, you have a good chance of getting it to work by trying some axis assignments manually. 

## Supported devices

At the time of writing this documentation, known devices include the following:

- Competition Pro SL-650212
- Competition Pro SL-6602
- Nimbus+
- iNNEXT Retro (SNES)
- Mayflash Magic-NS 1.2
- XBox Carbon Black
- XBox One Wired Controller
- Sony DualShock 3
- Sony DualShock 4
- Sony DualShock 4 (2nd Gen)
- Sony DualSense
- HORIPAD for Nintendo Switch
- The C64 Joystick

## Supported USB adapters

With the help of a USB retro adapter you can also connect original Commodore joysticks. vAmiga has been tested with the following two adapters:

- aJoy Retro Adapter
- RetroFun! Joystick Adapter

My personal recommendation is to invest in the Competition Pro SL-650212. It has lower latency than its predecessor, the SL-6602, and offers the best retro experience in my opinion. Also, I can recommend using an original Competition Pro from back in the day in combination with the RetroFun!
