# Supported File Formats

## Floppy disks

vAmiga supports the following file formats for floppy disks:

- **ADF format**

- **Extended ADF format**

- **DMS Format**

  DMS files store a digital image of an Amiga floppy disk, just like ADFs. However, the internal representation is much more complicated. The format is very popular in the demo scene. Thus, you will find many demos encoded in this format.

- **EXE Format**
	
  vAmiga also supports pure Amiga executables. When such a file is passed to the emulator, vAmiga creates a floppy disk on-the-fly and copies the executable to it. It also makes the floppy bootable by adding a boot block and a startup sequence that loads the executable.

- **IMG Format**

  Image files are floppy disks in MS-DOS format. Inserting such a floppy disk makes sense only if you use special software that can read such floppy disks.

- **Folders**

## Hard drives

- **HDF Format**
