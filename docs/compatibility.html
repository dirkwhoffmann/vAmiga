								<h3>Blitter accuracy</h3>

								<p>
									Amiga supports three Blitter accuracy levels. Level 0 is the fastest option. In this
									mode, all data is moved together in a single chunk when the BLTSIZE register is
									written. Although this option is far from being accurate, many games do work with
									this option. In level 1, the Blitter also moves the data in a single chunk, just as
									in level 0. However, bus timing is emulated afterwards. This means that vAmiga
									blocks the data bus in exactly the same cycles as the real Blitter would. Level 2 is
									recommended in all scenarios where high accuracy is required. In this mode, the
									Blitter is emulated cycle by cycle. It transfers data in the exact same cycles as
									the real Blitter would.
								</p>

								<h3>Emulate Slow Ram Mirror</h3>

								<p>
									This option enables a special Agnus feature that makes Slow Ram accessible to DMA.
									In the 512 MB Chip Ram + 512 Slow Ram configuration, the ECS Agnus revisions map
									Slow Ram to the second Chip Ram segment. If an OCS Agnus is selected, this option
									has no effect.
								</p>

								<h3>Emulate TOD bug</h3>

								<p>
									The Amiga CIAs exhibit a bug in the circuitry of the 24-bit counter, commonly
									referred to as the TOD bug. The bug is part of the increment logic which can falsely
									trigger a TOD interrupt. This happens when the alarm value matches the counter
									values at the time when the lowest three nibbles finished to increment.
								</p>

								<h3>Sync CIA accesses with E-clock</h3>

								<p>
									In the Amiga, the CIAs are driven by the M68000 CPU's E-clock, a special signal that
									is output at a frequency equal to one tenth of the native clock rate. Before the CPU
									can read or write a CIA register, it must synchronize with the E clock, which
									slightly slows down program execution. If you disable this option, synchronization
									with the E clock is skipped. In this case vAmiga can access CIA registers as fast as
									all other memory cells.
								</p>

								<h3>Emulate Slow-Ram bus delays</h3>

								<p>
									On a real Amiga, the CPU requires a free DMA cycle to access Slow Ram. Hence the
									name Slow Ram. Disabling this option removes this restriction, allowing the CPU to
									access Slow Ram at the same speed as Fast Ram.
								</p>

								<h3>Floppy drive speed</h3>

								<p>
									vAmiga supports two basic hard disk DMA modes: Standard DMA mode (compatible, but
									slow) and Turbo DMA mode (fast, but less compatible). In Standard DMA mode, vAmiga
									performs three DMA accesses per scan line, just like the original Amiga.
								</p>
								<p>
									To speed up Standard DMA mode, drives can be run with an acceleration factor. In
									this case, several words are transferred in each DMA slot of the drive.
								</p>
								<p>
									Turbo DMA is applied when the drive is configured as a Turbo drive. In this mode,
									data is transferred immediately when the DSKLEN register is written. Although this
									mode is far from being precise, many games and demos can be run in this mode without
									any issues.
								</p>

								<h3>Emulate mechanical delays</h3>

								<p>
									When this option is enabled, vAmiga imposes stricter timing constraints. That is, it
									emulates the acceleration and deceleration phases of the drive motor as well as the
									delay caused by the movement of the drive head from one cylinder to the next.
								</p>

								<h3>Piracy</h3>

								<p>
									These options are rarely needed, but can help to bypass copy protection mechanisms.
									The first option locks the DSKSYNC register. This means that any attempt to change
									the default SYNC word will be ignored by the emulator. The second option tells
									vAmiga to issue a disk sync interrupt even for the tracks that do not contain a SYNC
									word.
								</p>

								<h3>Sprites</h3>

								<p>
									vAmiga allows to disable the collision checking circuity which is part of Denise. By
									default, collision checking is disabled because it is expensive to emulate in
									software and only a few titles rely on it (e.g. Archon and Rotor).
								</p>

								<h3>Transmit key codes bit by bit</h3>

								<p>
									The keyboard is a central input device of the Amiga. While Commodore had equipped
									the Amiga 1000 and the Amiga 2000 with an external keyboard, they decided to
									integrate the keyboard directly into the case of the Amiga 500. This was only an
									aesthetic difference, though, as the connection to the
									motherboard was always the same. The keyboard first generates a key code for each
									pressed key. After that, it sends the code bit by bit to the CIA. As soon as the
									last bit is received, an interrupt is triggered and the interrupt handler takes
									over. By enabling this option, vAmiga emulates the bit-by-bit transmission exactly
									as described. Disabling this option tells vAmiga to skip the transmission phase and
									to write the generated keycode directly into the corresponding CIA register. This
									speeds up emulation, but is less accurate.
