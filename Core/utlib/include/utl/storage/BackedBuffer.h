/* A byte buffer that loads its contents from a file as they are needed.
 *
 * The buffer has a size of its own. The file may be shorter -- the bytes it
 * does not cover read as zero -- or longer, in which case the excess is
 * neither read nor touched. A buffer may also have no file at all: it is then
 * a plain buffer in memory, zero throughout until something is written.
 *
 * Contents are handed out as views. Asking for a view loads whatever part of
 * the requested region has not been loaded before; the rest of the buffer
 * stays where it is, in the file. What a view shows is therefore exactly what
 * the file held when that part was first asked for, or what was written into
 * the buffer since.
 *
 *   byteView()         a read-only view
 *   mutableByteView()  a writable view. The region counts as modified from
 *                      this moment on, whether or not anything is written
 *                      through it.
 *
 * Nothing reaches the file until persist() is called. It writes every modified
 * region back, and nothing else. If it writes anything at all, it first grows
 * a file that is shorter than the buffer to the buffer's size, so an image
 * saved by us always has the size we gave it. Unmodified buffers leave their
 * file alone, however short.
 *
 *   readOnly  persist() does nothing. Modifications are still tracked, so a
 *             buffer whose flag is cleared again can persist them later.
 *
 * The buffer keeps track of what it has loaded and modified in pages of
 * pageSize bytes. That is the granularity of both: asking for a single byte
 * loads its page, and modifying a single byte writes its page back. Adjacent
 * pages are loaded, and written, in one go.
 *
 * Memory:
 *
 * The buffer reserves its full size up front, but the operating system only
 * provides memory for the pages that are touched, so a buffer far larger than
 * RAM costs what has been loaded. Views stay valid for as long as the buffer
 * holds its storage; nothing but dealloc() moves or frees it.
 *
 * Things this class does not do:
 *
 * - Write anything by itself. A buffer that goes away unpersisted loses its
 *   modifications, by design.
 * - Handle a file that is not the bytes themselves. A compressed file is
 *   unpacked before it gets here (see retro::vault::BinaryImage).
 * - Notice changes made to the file by someone else. The file is ours while
 *   the buffer uses it.
 * - Synchronize. Like any buffer, it is used by one thread at a time.
